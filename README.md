# Todo-MVP

## Overview

Todo-MVP is a project that showcases how to build web applications using HTML, CSS, and minimal server-side code. The project revolves around a Todo Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - a basic yet valuable application for task management.

## Key Components

The project includes multiple Todo applications in various programming languages, all serving the same HTML and implementing a consistent API. The goal is to demonstrate that complex functionalities of JavaScript frameworks can be achieved using HTML, CSS, and simple server-side code without the need for JavaScript, frameworks, or persistence mechanisms.

## Philosophy

Todo-MVP promotes a back-to-basics approach, advocating for the use of fundamental web technologies like HTML5 and CSS3 instead of relying on heavy frameworks. It encourages developers to focus on writing clean, accessible HTML, using plain CSS for styling, and adhering to a standardized API across different language implementations.

## Constraints

The project sets constraints such as avoiding JavaScript, frameworks, persistence mechanisms, user sessions, and emphasizing identical HTML output and plain CSS styles across all implementations. 

## Testing

An acceptance test verifies the correctness of the HTML and API, ensuring consistency among different versions of the application.

## Conclusion

Overall, Todo-MVP aims to simplify the process of building web applications by leveraging core web technologies effectively and promoting a minimalist approach to web development.
